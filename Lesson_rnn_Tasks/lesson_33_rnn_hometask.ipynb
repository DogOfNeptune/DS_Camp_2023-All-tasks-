      "    between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and i then, putting my\n",

      "that was then rising. but it refreshed me and ﬁlled me with such agreeable\n",
      "sensations that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and ﬁxing the rudder in a\n",
      "direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. clouds hid the moon,\n",
      "everything was obscure, and i heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut\n",
      "through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time i slept soundly.\n",
      "    i do not know how long i remained in this situation, but when i awoke i found that\n",
      "the sun had already mounted considerably. the wind was high, and the waves\n",
      "continually threatened the safety of my little skiﬀ. i found that the wind was\n",
      "northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which i had embarked. i\n",
      "endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if i again made the attempt\n",
      "the boat would be instantly ﬁlled with water. thus situated, my only resource was to\n",

      "of the world that the sun was of little beneﬁt to me. i might be driven into the wide\n",

      "many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other suﬀerings.\n",
      "i looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that ﬂew before the wind,\n",
      "only to be replaced by others; i looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave. “fiend,”\n",
      "i exclaimed, “your task is already fulﬁlled!” i thought of elizabeth, of my father, and\n",
      "of clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and\n",
      "merciless passions. this idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful\n",

      "    some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\n",

      "the rudder, when suddenly i saw a line of high land towards the south.\n",
      "    almost spent, as i was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured for\n",
      "several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a ﬂood of warm joy to my\n",
      "heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\n",
      "    how mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of\n",
      "life even in the excess of misery! i constructed another sail with a part of my dress\n",
      "and eagerly steered my course towards the land. it had a wild and rocky\n",
      "appearance, but as i approached nearer i easily perceived the traces of cultivation.\n",
      "i saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the\n",
      "neighbourhood of civilised man. i carefully traced the windings of the land and\n",
      "hailed a steeple which i at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. as i\n",

      "place where i could most easily procure nourishment. fortunately i had money with\n",
      "\fme. as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good harbour,\n",
      "which i entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.\n",
      "   as i was occupied in ﬁxing the boat and arranging the sails, several people\n",
      "crowded towards the spot. they seemed much surprised at my appearance, but\n",
      "instead of oﬀering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any\n",
      "other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. as it was, i\n",
      "merely remarked that they spoke english, and i therefore addressed them in that\n",

      "this town and inform me where i am?”\n",

      "consulted as to your quarters, i promise you.”\n",
      "   i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and i\n",
      "was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his\n",
      "companions. “why do you answer me so roughly?” i replied. “surely it is not the\n",
      "custom of englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.”\n",
      "   “i do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the english may be, but it is\n",
      "the custom of the irish to hate villains.”\n",
      "   while this strange dialogue continued, i perceived the crowd rapidly increase.\n",
      "their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some\n",
      "degree alarmed me. i inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied. i then moved\n",
      "forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and\n",
      "surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder\n",
      "and said, “come, sir, you must follow me to mr. kirwin’s to give an account of\n",

      "   this answer startled me, but i presently recovered myself. i was innocent; that\n",

      "witnesses on this occasion.\n",
      "   about half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\n",
      "magistrate, he deposed that he had been out ﬁshing the night before with his son\n",
      "and brother-in-law, daniel nugent, when, about ten o’clock, they observed a strong\n",

      "who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination\n",
      "they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold.\n",
      "they instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and\n",
      "endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life. it appeared to be a handsome young\n",

      "which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. the magistrate observed me with a\n",
      "keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.\n",

      "swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a\n",
      "single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by\n",

      "   several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that,\n",
